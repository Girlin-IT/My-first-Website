        <p4>He is the current Sound Hashira and uses the Sound Breathing.</p4>
            <br>
        <p3>Tengen is an eccentric and flashy individual, always wanting to be flamboyant, possessing a need for everything to be flashy and outstanding.
            However, he also has a caring side that is masked under his flamboyant façade, one he only shows to those that are extremely close to him,especially his three wives.
            He looks up to people like Kyojuro Rengoku. Having been raised as a Shinobi(Ninja), has greater tactical skills and sharper senses, especially his sense of hearing.
            Tengen is the fastest runner out of all the Hashira, and thus possesses tremendous levels of raw speed and reflexes. He is also the second physically strongest Hashira.
            His training as a Shinobi made him extremely pain tolerant and poison resistant, he also possesses great technical skill in weaponry such as kunai and explosives.
            Tengen possesses an undaunted spirit and immense willpower, never faltering even when faced disadvantages and difficult circumstances.
            Due to accumulating years of experience as both a ninja and Demon Slayer, Tengen has incredible judgement, making decisions on the fly.
            Befitting Tengen's flamboyant personality, he carries an equally flamboyant set of weaponry. As his main weapons, he uses two gigantic Nichirin cleavers that are amber in color.
            The blades are are held together at the hilt by a metal chain, making it very similar to nunchucks and are engreaved with the phrase Destroyer of Demons. 
            The amber-colored blade symbolises sound. Tengen doesn't use a sword sheath and instead carries them on his back, having them wrapped in cloth.

        <p4>She is the current Insect Hashira and uses the Insect Breathing.</p4>
            <br>
        <p3>Shinobu displays a bright, friendly and cheerful demeanor, always having an easygoing smile on her face regardless of the situation she is in.
            However, her outward behavior is shown very quickly to be a façade. She enjoys teasing others, to the point of being rather sadistic about it, enjoying most notably to pick on Giyu Tomioka.
            Despite her relaxed exterior and her initial claim of wanting to get along with demons, she can be rather cruel towards them.
            Despite not possessing the physical strength to cut off a demon's head common to that of an average Demon Slayer, she uses her creativity, ingenuity and other physical abilities to more than make up for it.
            Other than her intellect, she is extremely fast and agile, allowing her to overpower demons very quickly. She displays immense skill and mastery inover medical and pharmaceutical fields to make up for her lack of natural-born combat ability.
            Instead of the traditional method of decapitating a demon with a Nichirin Sword to kill them, Shinobu opts to use a modified version of a katana that acts as a stinger to inject lethal Wisteria poison that is poisonous to demons.
            She created her breathing style to compensate for her lack of physical strength to cut off a demon's head.
            She carries a heavily modified Nichirin Katana which  ends in a needle-like tip, resembling an insect's stinger in appearance and function.
            The lavender-blue blade symbolised Insect. The words Evil Demon are engraved on the right face, while the words Destruction are engraved on the left face due her sword's structure.

        <p4>He is the current Flame Hashira and uses the Flame Breathing.</p4>
            <br>
        <p3>Kyojuro is greatly enthusiastic in regard to his duties as a Hashira, and often came across as cheerfully eccentric.
            He is an honorable warrior who adhered to his code of morals and principles. He is amiable, pure of heart, and boasted extraordinary technique and swordsmanship.
            Beneath his enthusiastic demeanor, Kyojuro is very logical and tactically intelligent, acting quickly and precisely in battle, especially when the lives of others are on the line.
            He is part of the Rengoku family which has an impressive lineage of powerful swordsmen and Flame Hashira.
            He possesses amazing physical strength, being capable of swinging his katana at speeds faster than the eye can see.
            He has incredibly honed senses, capable of sensing demonic presences faster and more accurately.            
            Kyojuro carried a standard sized and shaped katana made from scarlet ore that is a deep shade of reddish-orange in color with the words Destroyer of Demons engraved on the side.
            The red colored blade symbolizes fire and represents the user's unbreakable will. Kyojuro died protecting his comrades, and he refused to let anyone get injured in the process.
